# Instructions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Intructions: 1. `npm i`. 2. `npm start`.

This is a handmade fully-responsive website designed on a 13-inch Mac that does not use any CSS templates like bootstrap. 

It has been written as part of a coding challenge set out by a company who interviewed me. This is the prompt:

There is a VW client called “Premium Volkswagen” who are looking for a new car page designed for the new Volkswagen e-Golf

The page needs to include a header with a navigation bar, a main image, a way for customers to register their interest in the car to the dealership (a form, a call to action, whatever you think is most appropriate) and finally a footer. It can include anything else you think is cool/appropriate.

The header and footer will have all the links to other areas of the site but these won’t go anywhere. We just want to see a new page design.

This must be fluid responsive and elements must be designed accordingly. We encourage well thought out interaction design. This would be a good opportunity to show off your Javascript/Jquery knowledge.

Please do not use a template, but we encourage use of front end frameworks (such as boostrap).
